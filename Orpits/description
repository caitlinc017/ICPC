The formula for the number of Orpits in the next generation (in this case the next day), given the number in the current generation is:
- if number of orpits > 10 then half of the orpits die
- if number of orpits is greater than 1 AND less than or equal to 10 then the population doubles, plus 3 more and minus the current 
  generation number
- if number of orpits is less than or equal to one, then there is no next generation since one orpit can not reproduce.

Write a program which will read a single integer number representing a pre-invasion force size. THe ouput should be a series of lines,
one for each generation in which there is at least one Orpit alive, containing the generation number and a bar grpah showing the size
of the orbit population for that generation. THe bar graph should contain one * for each orpit in the population, separated by a singe 
blank, with all bars left adjusted to the same point. The first generation is the generation 0 and will always consist of one orpit. The
last generation will never be more than generation 13, since the orpits will decide on whether to proceed with the invasion after 13 days
have passed. You may assume that the population never grows so large that is cannot be represented on a single line of output
