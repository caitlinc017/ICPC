//In a peer to peer network, a peer can request a file from other peers. Usually a file is divided into multiple file chunks
//and so to get a file a peer must first get a copy of all of its chunks. At any given time, different peers may have different subsets
//of the file chunks. If Alice is a newly joined peer in the P2P network, Alice will ask each peer for the list of file chunks they
//have, and then request chunks from appropriate peers. We assum that Alice will use the following principles when making requests

1)Alice will request the chunks based on the order of rareness. That is, the file chunks held by the fewest number of
peer will be requested first
2)If two or more file chunks have the same rareness, Alice will follow the numerical order of file chunks to make the request
3)If one file chunk is available on multiple peers, Alice will request from the peer with greatest speed

In this problem, we assume a file is divided into four chunks 1,2,3,4. The current network has four peers: A,B,C, and Alice.
Alice is the newly joined peer and will request chunks from A,B,C. The peers' speed of sending files has the relationship
A>B>C. Given the lists of available chunks on each peer, you need to print out the request ordere of chunks and from whom.

For example, if the list of chunks available on the peers are:
A: 1 3 4
B: 1 2 4
C: 1 3
By following the principles mentioned above, Alice will request chunks following the order below: request 2 from B, 
request 3 from A, request 4 from A, and request 1 from A

Input
The input is a single token encoding the list of available chunks on each peer. THe encoding is a peer letter followed by zero to four 
chunks digits, once for each peer. The letters will come A to C, from left to right, and digits will be in numeric order. From the
example above, the input would be A134B124C13

Output
The output is Alice's order of chunk requests, with each chunk request being a chunk number followed by peer letter. The chunk requests 
should be ordered from left to right and concatenated together. For the example above, the output is 2B3A4A1A.
